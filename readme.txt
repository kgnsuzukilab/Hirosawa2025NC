This program set is a set of Matlab custom codes for generating and analyzing PALM movies and consists of the following three programs.
gen_palm_eta.m
gen_palm_zeta.m
wintld_gamma.m

gen_palm_eta.m reads molecular information (csv file) generated by ThunderSTORM and creates PALM movies.
gen_palm_zeta.m is a computation engine for generating PALM movies called from gen_palm_eta.m.
wintld_gamma.m reads the trajectory data output by WinATR for single-particle tracking and analyzes the positional relationship with the structure represented in the PALM video image.
